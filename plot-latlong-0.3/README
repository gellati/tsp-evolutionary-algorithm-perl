DESCRIPTION

plot-latlong is a small command line tool written in perl for plotting
points on geographic maps given a list of latitude/longitude (lat/long)
pairs.  This is aimed at situations in which

  * a moderate amount of accuracy and precision is sufficient
  * a large number of locations need to be plotted (tens of thousands of
    locations can be easily handled)
  * the plotting needs to be automatable (from a shell script, for example)
  * a lightweight tool (both small and with few dependencies) that just plots
    points is sufficient
  * ease of modification is important (so that special requirements can be
    met)

plot-latlong can handle nonlinear map projections (currently the
Alber/Lambert projection) and is intentionally minimalistic so that it can
serve as a building block.  Users can build upon it in three ways: (1) add
new maps, (2) run the output images through packages like NetPBM to add
titles, etc., and (3) modify the source to change how points are drawn, to
add labels, etc.  plot-latlong can also be used to simply compute the
mapping from lat/long to pixel coordinates (for a given map).  These pixel
coordinates can then be fed to other programs to draw more elaborate
pictures.

IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

The list of implemented features is intentionally short:

  * drawing points at a user-specified size
  * printing out just the pixel coordinates of input lat/long pairs
  * support for linear projections (the relationship between pixels
    and lat/long values is linear)
  * support for the Alber/Lambert nonlinear projection

The distribution includes over two dozen maps, covering the continents
and several country groups.  Users can also supply maps to use, so
long as the projection type is supported and the projection parameters
are known.

CAVEATS

plot-latlong is unsuitable for applications demanding high accuracy.
Accuracy is likely no better than 5-10 miles--and even this is merely a
shot in the dark, since we're not in a position to rigorously determine the
accuracy of the generated plots.  The following factors contribute to
increased inaccuracy:

  * the relative coarseness of the supplied maps
  * unverified projection parameters for the supplied maps
  * the USA maps, which use the Alber/Lambert projection, have parameters
    calibrated by eye
  * the geodetic datum assumed by the supplied maps is unknown to us
    (http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/datum/datum_f.html)

     + lat/long coordinate values are not universal; values are always
       specified in some system, the datum, and mismatches in the assumed
       datum can lead to the specification of physical locations that are
       separated by as much as 1km

     + to assess whether plot-latlong will be sufficient for your needs,
       you might try comparing the results with those from the
       Tiger Map Server (http://tiger.census.gov/cgi-bin/mapbrowse-tbl/)
       and MapQuest (http://www.mapquest.com/maps/latlong.adp).

REQUIREMENTS

The requirements for running plot-latlong are:

  * UNIX-like operating system
  * perl (http://www.perl.com)
  * GD.pm (http://stein.cshl.org/WWW/software/GD/), which in turn requires
    (see the README of GD.pm):

     + the gd graphics library (http://www.boutell.com/gd/)
     + the PNG graphics library (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
     + the zlib compression library (http://www.gzip.org/zlib/)

INSTALLATION

No installation, per se, is required, but for the greatest convenience,
it is best to copy some files to your home directory, as in the following:

     cp plot-latlong $HOME/bin
     cp -R .mapinfo .mapimages $HOME

Assuming $HOME/bin is in your PATH, you can now run plot-latlong from
anywhere.

USAGE

plot-latlong reads lat/long values from stdin and writes a PNG to
stdout.  The input should contain one pair of lat/long values per line
with the values separated by whitespace.  Each coordinate should be a
decimal value, with negative values indicating south or west.  Blank lines
and lines starting with the pound character ('#') are ignored.

Command line options are

  -m <map-name> specifies the name of a map to use (default: the first
     map listed in .mapinfo: 'World'); see .mapinfo for the valid map names;
     see the file CONFIG for a description of the .mapinfo format

  -s <point-size> specifies the size of the points to draw (default: 1);
     points are filled squares, and the size is the width in pixels

     (NOTE: Points drawn at the default size of 1 pixel may be hard to see
            when only a few points are plotted.  Use '-s 10' when plotting
            a small number of points.)

  -c causes the pixel coordinates of each lat/long to be printed to stderr;
     the coordinates (0, 0) are at the upper left corner, and values increase
     to the right and down

  -i <map-info-file> specifies an alternate location for .mapinfo (other
     than in the current directory or $HOME).

Examples:

$ cat locations.txt | ./plot-latlong >plot.png

$ ./plot-latlong -m USA -s 10 >plot.png <<EOF
# san diego
32.8155594 -117.1361008

NOTE: You may safely ignore the following warning:

             gd-png warning: alpha channel not supported

      This warning says that the input map image had transparency information,
      which some GD versions don't support.  None of the map images included
      in the distribution have transparency, but maps of your own may.
      In such cases, use an image editing tool to remove the transparency
      information.
