OVERVIEW

This document describes the format of the .mapinfo configuration file,
which specifies the maps (and their projection parameters) available to
users of plot-latlong.

SYNTAX

The .mapinfo file has a simple line-oriented syntax.  Each line
independently specifies some piece of information, and the order of the
lines is unimportant.  Blank lines and lines starting with '#', which
may be preceded by whitespace, are ignored.  All other lines must have
the syntax described below.

We use a few conventions in the following description of the syntax.
Placeholders are denoted by words enclosed in angle brackets (e.g.,
<map-name>).  All other words are literals that should be included
verbatim.  The order of the words on each line is significant.  One or
more whitespace characters should separate the individual words on each line.

1) map definitions:

  MAP <map-name> <image-path> <top-lat> <top-long> <bot-lat> <bot-long>

  MAP World World100.png 90 -170 -90 190

These lines specify a map that is available to the user and supply some
basic attributes.

The values are

  <map-name> -- the name of the map; this is the name used for the '-m'
             command line argument; the name must consist of letters,
             digits, and underscores--no spaces are allowed

  <image-path> -- the name of the PNG file containing the map image; the
             path is relative to the location of the .mapimages directory,
             so in most cases, the path can be a simple filename such as
             "World100.png"

  <top-lat>
  <top-long> -- the lat/long of the top-left corner of the map image in
             decimal degrees

  <bot-lat>
  <bot-long> -- the lat/long of the bottom-right corner of the map image in
             decimal degrees


2) map projection parameters:

  PROJECTION <map-name> <projection-name> <projection parameters>

  PROJECTION  USA50 ALBER  704.0 30.8 45.5 21.86 -99.9 232 388

These lines specify the parameters for nonlinear map projections.  In
contrast, the values given in MAP lines are sufficient for linear map
projections.

The values are

  <map-name> -- the name of the map; this value should match the name used
             in the corresponding MAP line

  <projection-name> -- the name of the nonlinear projection that will be
             applied to the map; currently, if maps are not linear, they may
             have one nonlinear projection specified for them; multiple
             nonlinear projections for the same map are not allowed

  <projection parameters> -- a variable set of values that provides the
             actual parameters for the map projection; see below for details


The following describes the supported projections and their parameters.
Only one projection is currently supported:

  ALBER -- an Alber/Lambert projection; this is used by the USA maps
           included in the distribution    

           See the publication "Map Projections Used by the U.S. Geological
           Survey Bulletin 1532" for details about this projection.

    parameters:

     <R> <phi_1> <phi_2> <phi_0> <lambda_0> <false-easting> <false-northing>

     where

       <R> -- radius of sphere
       <phi_1> -- standard parallel (lower)
       <phi_2> -- standard parallel (upper)
       <phi_0> -- origin latitude
       <lambda_0> -- origin longitude
       <false-easting> -- the false easting amount
       <false-northing> -- the false northing amount

TIPS & TRICKS

Creating maps at different scales is both useful and relatively easy.
The following describes the steps for creating maps at different scales
using existing maps:

 1) Use an image editing tool/package like ImageMagick or NetPBM to create
    a map image at a different size; e.g.,

      convert -scale '50%' .mapimages/World100.png .mapimages/World50.png

    would create a half-sized image using the 'convert' tool of ImageMagick.

 2) Add a MAP line to .mapinfo; specifically, copy the MAP line of the 
    source map and change the map name and image path--don't change the
    lat/long parameters; e.g.,

         MAP World100 World100.png 90 -170 -90 190
     =>  MAP World50  World50.png  90 -170 -90 190

 3) For maps created with nonlinear projections, add a PROJECTION line to
    .mapinfo; again, you may simply copy and tweak the PROJECTION line of
    the source map; e.g.,

        PROJECTION  USA50 ALBER  704.0 30.8 45.5 21.86 -99.9 232 388
        PROJECTION USA100 ALBER 1408.0 30.8 45.5 21.86 -99.9 464 776
        PROJECTION USA200 ALBER 2816.0 30.8 45.5 21.86 -99.9 928 1552

    For the Alber/Lambert projection, you need only change the <R>,
    <false-easting>, and <false-northing> parameters.  These values change
    in direct proportion to the change in size of the image itself.  For
    example, if the size is halved, then these parameter values should be
    halved; if the size is doubled, then the values should be doubled.
    In the above example, USA100 is the USA map at 100%; USA50 and USA200
    represent images at 50% and 200%, respectively.
